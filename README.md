Sven smart vending machine

For my update I improved the interface of the Sven demo. In order to do this I obtained ASCII art from http://www.angelfire.com/co/cajhnesplace/ascii/vend.html and heavily customized it to fit the look of Sven. I then implicated the ASCII art into the program by using a display method used on line 222 and titled "displayMachine()". I then went line by line copying each section of the ASCII art and ading them into the interface by using 29 System.out.println statements on lines 224-252. After I added the ASCII art into Minich's code Jack H got the great idea to color the ASCII art in order to make it appealing to the user and match the program.
